# Library Management System

This project is a simple Library Management System developed in Java, utilizing Swing for the GUI and MySQL for the database backend.

## Update Functionality

The update function allows users to modify existing book records in the library database. Here's how it works:

1. **User Interface**: The GUI provides a form where users can input the details of the book they want to update, including the ISBN, book name, author, and publisher.

2. **Update Button**: Upon clicking the "Update" button, the application triggers an update query in the database, modifying the book's details based on the provided ISBN.

3. **Feedback**: After the update operation is completed, the system displays a message dialog confirming the successful update.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Set Up the Database**: Ensure you have MySQL installed, and import the provided database schema to set up the library database.

3. **Compile and Run**: Compile the Java files and run the `student.java` file to launch the Library Management System application.

4. **Interact with the UI**: Use the provided GUI to perform various operations such as adding, updating, and deleting book records.
